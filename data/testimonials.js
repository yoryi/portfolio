It was an absolute pleasure to work with him. The designer listened to my thoughts and suggestions and far surpassed my expectations. There were minor problems along the way; these were sorted out quickly and efficiently. We are looking forward to working with him on future projects. Anyone seeking a reference can call me anytime. You would be extremely unwise to overlook such a dedicated and professional engineer.",
